# 11 is nothing more than a coffee-script node project template

[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/tharry/t1/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/tharry/t1)

t1 is a project template that might be or might be not of any use for anyone.
What is set up in t1:
* node
* grunt
* coffee-script
* mocha tests
* coffee test coverage via istanbul
* it's truly free

I think that most of it is self explanatory and package.json
and Gruntfile.coffee are the fist places to look at.
The code does nothing fancy but everything has to have a start.
